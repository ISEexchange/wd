## Overview

This program acts as a watchdog timer to start other programs.
The other program must finish within a configurable timeout or
else the other program is killed.

It has been tested on Fedora, RHEL, and Mac OS X.
The source compiles without change on each of these OS's.

## Building

You need EiffelStudio to build this.
I use the GPL version available from http://www.eiffelstudio.com

See eiffelstudio.md for instructions if you want to install
EiffelStudio locally on Linux or Mac OSX.

### Use docker to build wd

The easiest way to use EiffelStudio on Linux is via Docker containers.
See http://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/ for tips.


Run the [EiffelStudio docker container](https://index.docker.io/u/jumanjiman/eiffelstudio/).
When you first run the container, docker will download it.
Subsequent startups are almost instantaneous.

    sudo docker run -i -t -v /tmp:/tmp jumanjiman/eiffelstudio 

Inspect the environment.

    bash-4.2$ pwd
    /tmp

    bash-4.2$ env | grep -i home
    HOME=/tmp

    bash-4.2$ cat /etc/redhat-release 
    Fedora release 19 (Schrödinger’s Cat)

Clone this repo and build with tito...

    bash-4.2$ git clone https://github.com/jumanjiman/wd.git
    Cloning into 'wd'...

    bash-4.2$ cd wd

    bash-4.2$ tito build --rpm

...or build `wd` from the command-line using the provided `Makefile`

    make finalize
